# 🚀 BELL24H DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## ❌ **Current Issue: Vercel Deployment Failing**

The deployment keeps failing with "No Next.js version detected" error, even though:
- ✅ `next` is in package.json dependencies
- ✅ All files are in the correct location
- ✅ Build works locally

## 🎯 **SOLUTION: Manual Upload to Vercel**

### **Step 1: Create Deployment Package**
1. **Zip your project folder** (excluding node_modules)
2. **Upload to Vercel** via their dashboard

### **Step 2: Alternative - Try Different Vercel Settings**

#### **Option A: Check Root Directory Setting**
1. Go to **Vercel Project Settings**
2. Look for **"Root Directory"** setting
3. Make sure it's set to **"."** (current directory)
4. If it's set to a subdirectory, change it to **"."**

#### **Option B: Try Different Framework Detection**
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to **Settings**
2. Look for **"Framework Preset"**
3. Change it to **"Next.js"** explicitly
4. Save settings

### **Step 3: Manual File Upload**
1. **Go to Vercel dashboard**
2. **Click "Deployments"**
3. **Click "..." menu**
4. **Look for "Upload" or "Import" option**
5. **Upload your project files**

## 🔧 **What I Fixed Locally:**
- ✅ Removed `"type": "module"` from package.json
- ✅ Added proper vercel.json configuration
- ✅ Removed `output: 'standalone'` from next.config.js
- ✅ All Next.js dependencies are correct

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**
1. **Try the manual deployment again** with these fixes
2. **Check Vercel project settings** for root directory
3. **If still failing, try uploading files manually**

## 📞 **If All Else Fails:**
- **Contact Vercel support** with the error details
- **Or try deploying to a different platform** (Railway, Netlify, etc.)
