# Bell24h Marketplace - Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your Bell24h Marketplace application is ready for production deployment.

## 1. Code Quality and Testing ✅

- [ ] Lint the codebase to catch potential issues
      ```bash
      npm run lint
      ```
- [ ] Run all tests to ensure functionality works as expected
      ```bash
      npm test
      ```
- [ ] Check for any TypeScript type errors
      ```bash
      npm run typecheck
      ```

## 2. Security Considerations 🔒

- [ ] Ensure all API keys and secrets are stored as environment variables
- [ ] Verify CORS settings are properly configured
- [ ] Check that all user inputs are properly validated
- [ ] Ensure passwords are securely hashed (bcrypt)
- [ ] Verify SQL queries are protected against injection
- [ ] Review authentication flows for security issues
- [ ] Set secure and HTTP-only cookies for session management

## 3. Environment Variables 🌎

Make sure the following environment variables are configured:

- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- [ ] `SESSION_SECRET` - Strong, random string for session encryption
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Valid OpenAI API key
- [ ] `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production" for production environments
- [ ] `PORT` - Default port for the application (if needed)

## 4. Database Preparation 💾

- [ ] Perform a test migration to verify schema changes apply cleanly
      ```bash
      npm run db:push
      ```
- [ ] Create database backup before deployment
- [ ] Set up database monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure proper database connection pooling

## 5. Asset Optimization 🚀

- [ ] Build the client-side application
      ```bash
      npm run build
      ```
- [ ] Verify assets are properly optimized (images, JS, CSS)
- [ ] Enable compression for static assets
- [ ] Set up proper cache headers for assets

## 6. Performance Considerations ⚡

- [ ] Review API response times and optimize slow endpoints
- [ ] Implement pagination for list endpoints
- [ ] Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize database queries (indexes, query patterns)
- [ ] Enable gzip/brotli compression for responses

## 7. Monitoring and Logging 📊

- [ ] Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Configure application logging
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Create alerts for critical errors
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints

## 8. Infrastructure Setup 🏗️

- [ ] Choose deployment platform (Railway, Render, AWS, etc.)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Set up reverse proxy if needed (Nginx, Caddy)
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling if needed

## 9. Final Checks 🔍

- [ ] Verify WebSocket connections work in production environment
- [ ] Test user authentication flows
- [ ] Verify external API integrations (OpenAI, KredX, etc.)
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Verify error handling works as expected

## 10. Post-Deployment 🎯

- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Watch for unexpected errors
- [ ] Set up regular database backups
- [ ] Document deployment process for team members
- [ ] Create rollback plan for emergencies
