# Cross-Browser Testing Plan for Bell24H.com

## Objective
Ensure the Bell24H.com application works reliably across all major browsers and devices, providing a consistent user experience.

## Recommended Tools
- **BrowserStack**: Cloud-based, supports automated and manual testing across a wide range of browsers/devices.
- **Sauce Labs**: Alternative to BrowserStack, also supports a wide range of environments.
- **Playwright**: Already used for E2E, supports running tests in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit locally and on CI.

## Target Browsers
- Google Chrome (latest + 2 previous)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest + 2 previous)
- Microsoft Edge (latest + 2 previous)
- Apple Safari (latest + 2 previous)
- Mobile browsers: Chrome (Android), Safari (iOS)

## Approach
1. **Automated Cross-Browser E2E Tests**
   - Use Playwright to run E2E tests in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
   - Integrate with BrowserStack/Sauce Labs for broader coverage if needed.
2. **Manual Spot Checks**
   - Use BrowserStack Live for manual exploratory testing on various devices and browsers.
3. **CI Integration**
   - Integrate automated cross-browser tests into CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions early.

## Example Playwright Config (for local cross-browser runs)
```js
// playwright.config.js
module.exports = {
  projects: [
    { name: 'Chromium', use: { browserName: 'chromium' } },
    { name: 'Firefox', use: { browserName: 'firefox' } },
    { name: 'WebKit', use: { browserName: 'webkit' } },
  ],
};
```

## Visual Regression Testing
Visual regression testing ensures that UI changes do not introduce unwanted visual bugs. Playwright supports snapshot comparisons out of the box.

- See `tests/e2e/visual-regression.test.ts` for a template.
- Example usage:
  ```ts
  import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
  test('homepage visual snapshot', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
    expect(await page.screenshot()).toMatchSnapshot('homepage.png', { threshold: 0.2 });
  });
  ```
- Best Practices:
  - Run visual tests in CI for all major browsers.
  - Review and approve new snapshots after intentional UI changes.
  - Store baseline snapshots in version control for traceability.

## Next Steps
- Set up BrowserStack or Sauce Labs account.
- Integrate Playwright with BrowserStack for automated runs.
- Add more E2E scenarios for critical user flows.
