# Monitoring & APM Integration for Bell24H.com

## Why Monitoring?
Monitoring ensures your application is healthy, performant, and secure. It helps you detect issues before users do.

## Recommended APM Tools
- **New Relic**
- **Datadog**
- **Elastic APM**
- **Prometheus + Grafana**

## Key Metrics to Track
- API response times (p95, p99)
- Error rates (4xx, 5xx)
- Throughput (requests per minute)
- Database query timings
- External API/service latencies
- Custom business metrics (e.g., escrow creation rate)

## Implementation Steps
1. Choose an APM provider and set up an account.
2. Install the provider's Node.js/Express agent (see their docs).
3. Add initialization code to your Express server entry point.
4. Set up dashboards and alerts for key metrics.

## Example (New Relic)
```js
// At the very top of your main server file
require('newrelic');
```

## Next Steps
- Integrate chosen APM agent
- Define alert thresholds for critical metrics
- Regularly review dashboards
