# Milestone Contracts: User Documentation

## Overview
Milestone contracts are smart contracts that release funds in stages as project milestones are completed and approved. This ensures transparency, security, and fair payment for all parties.

## How It Works
1. **Contract Creation:** A smart contract is deployed with the agreed milestones and payment schedule.
2. **Deposits:** The client deposits the total project amount into the contract.
3. **Milestone Completion:** As each milestone is completed, the contractor submits proof or deliverables.
4. **Approval:** The client reviews and approves the milestone.
5. **Disbursement:** Upon approval, the contract automatically releases the payment for that milestone to the contractor.
6. **Repeat:** Steps 3-5 repeat for each milestone until the contract is complete.

## User Steps
### For Clients:
- Review and approve milestones via the dashboard.
- Deposit funds to the contract address provided.
- Track progress and payment status in real time.

### For Contractors:
- Submit deliverables for each milestone.
- Monitor approval status and receive payments automatically.

## Security & Best Practices
- Always verify the contract address before depositing funds.
- Use a reputable wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for all blockchain interactions.
- Never share your private key or seed phrase.
- Check the contractâ€™s audit status if available.

## Troubleshooting
- If a milestone is not approved, contact support or use the dispute resolution process.
- For failed transactions, check your wallet balance and network fees.
