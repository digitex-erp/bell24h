### Database Changes
```sql
-- Add to users table
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN is_trial BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN trial_start_date TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN trial_end_date TIMESTAMP;

-- For tracking trial conversions
CREATE TABLE trial_conversions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  trial_start_date TIMESTAMP,
  conversion_date TIMESTAMP,
  selected_plan TEXT,
  conversion_source TEXT
);
```

### UI/UX Changes
1. **Trial Badge**: Display "Trial" badge in header when user is in trial period
2. **Countdown Timer**: Show days remaining in trial in user dashboard
3. **Feature Access**: No restrictions on feature access during trial
4. **Conversion Prompts**: 
   - Gentle reminder at 7 days remaining
   - More prominent reminder at 3 days remaining
   - Final reminder at 1 day remaining

### Backend Logic
```typescript
// Example function to check trial status
function checkTrialStatus(userId: number): TrialStatus {
  const user = getUserById(userId);
  
  if (!user.is_trial) {
    return { isTrialUser: false };
  }
  
  const currentDate = new Date();
  const trialEndDate = new Date(user.trial_end_date);
  const daysRemaining = Math.ceil((trialEndDate.getTime() - currentDate.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  
  return {
    isTrialUser: true,
    daysRemaining,
    expired: daysRemaining <= 0,
    needsReminder: [7, 3, 1].includes(daysRemaining)
  };
}
```
