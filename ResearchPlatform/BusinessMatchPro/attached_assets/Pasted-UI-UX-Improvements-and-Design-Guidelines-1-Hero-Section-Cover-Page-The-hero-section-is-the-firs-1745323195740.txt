Limitations of Replit.com for the Project
Replit is a great tool for prototyping and lightweight development, but it has some limitations for a full-fledged project like Bell24h.com:

Scalability :
Replit is not ideal for handling large-scale applications with heavy traffic.
It may struggle with resource-intensive tasks like WebSocket connections or machine learning model inference.
Database Management :
While Replit supports PostgreSQL, managing a production-grade database is better handled by dedicated services like AWS RDS or Render.
Deployment Options :
Replit’s deployment capabilities are limited compared to platforms like Render or Vercel, which offer autoscaling and CI/CD pipelines.
Custom Domain Support :
Replit does not natively support custom domains, which is crucial for branding.
Third-Party Integrations :
Replit may not handle complex integrations (e.g., WebSocket APIs, payment gateways) as seamlessly as other platforms.
Final Answer
Pending Work :
Complete WebSocket integration, API integrations (Kotak Securities, RazorpayX), security enhancements, and testing.
Focus on database optimization, mobile responsiveness, and advanced analytics post-launch.
UI/UX Improvements :
Redesign the hero section with a gradient background, tagline, and CTA button.
Enhance the features section with colorful icons, hover animations, and concise descriptions.
Add a stats section with animated counters and a "Why Choose Bell24h" section with testimonials.

Primary: #007BFF, Accent: #FFC107, Background: #F8F9FA.
Secondary: Success (#28A745), Warning (#FFC107), Error (#DC3545).
Replit Limitations :
Limited scalability, database management, deployment options, and third-party integrations.
By addressing these areas, Bell24h.com will have a polished, user-friendly interface and a robust backend ready for launch.
