Based on the provided information and your description, it is clear that the project is in its **final stage** on **Replit.com**. Here‚Äôs a structured breakdown of the current status, next steps, and advice for writing the next prompt:

---

### **1. Current Status**
- **Core Features**: Fully implemented (e.g., trading features, AI integration, WebSocket communication).
- **Alert System**: Needs to be finalized to notify users of important trade-related events.
- **Less Complete Tasks**:
  - **PDF Reports & Data Export**: Partially complete but needs enhancements like automated report generation and scheduled exports.
  - **Global Trade Insights**: Missing components like customs/regulatory intelligence and cross-border trade analytics.
  - **Advanced Alert System**: Requires email/SMS notifications, custom alert rules, and real-time triggering.
- **Documentation**: `TODO.md`, `features.md`, and `README.md` need updates to reflect the latest progress.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all components, features, tools, and database is pending.
- **Deployment Preparation**: Site map, launch pad, and AWS connection are required for deployment.

### **2. Next Steps**
Here‚Äôs how you can proceed systematically:

#### **Step 1: Finalize the Alert System**
- Implement the alert system to notify users of critical trade-related events:
  - Use multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, in-app).
  - Add real-time alert triggering and customizable alert templates.
  - Example Implementation:
    ```typescript
    const sendAlert = async (userId, message, channel) => {
      if (channel === 'email') {
        // Use Nodemailer or similar library for email notifications
      } else if (channel === 'sms') {
        // Use Twilio or similar service for SMS notifications
      } else {
        // In-app notification logic
      }
    };
    ```

#### **Step 2: Address "Less Complete Tasks"**
- **PDF Reports & Data Export**:
  - Automate daily summary reports and supplier performance reports.
  - Use libraries like `jspdf` and `chart.js` for PDF generation.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const generatePDF = () => {
      const doc = new jsPDF();
      doc.text("Daily Summary Report", 10, 10);
      doc.save("report.pdf");
    };
    ```
- **Global Trade Insights**:
  - Add import/export data for SMEs and cross-border trade analytics.
  - Use APIs like UN Comtrade or World Bank for trade data.
- **Advanced Alert System**:
  - Implement email/SMS notifications and custom alert rules.

#### **Step 3: Update Documentation**
- Update `TODO.md`, `features.md`, and `README.md` to reflect the latest progress:
  - Add completed tasks, remaining tasks, and future enhancements.
  - Example for `TODO.md`:
    ```markdown
    ## Completed Tasks
    - Core Platform: 100%
    - Trading Features: 100%
    - AI Integration: 100%

    ## Remaining Tasks
    - PDF Reports & Data Export: 70%
    - Global Trade Insights: 60%
    - Advanced Alert System: 45%
    ```

#### **Step 4: Comprehensive Testing**
- Test each component, feature, tool, and database:
  - Use testing frameworks like Jest, Cypress, or Mocha.
  - Generate a test report indicating readiness for deployment:
    ```markdown
    ## Test Report
    - Core Platform: Passed ‚úÖ
    - Trading Features: Passed ‚úÖ
    - Alert System: Passed ‚úÖ
    - PDF Reports: Passed with minor issues ‚ùå
    - Global Trade Insights: Pending ‚ùå
    ```

#### **Step 5: Generate Site Map and Launch Pad**
- Create a site map for navigation:
  - Example:
    ```plaintext
    Home
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dashboard
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RFQ Management
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Supplier Matching
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Analytics
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Settings
    ```
- Set up a launch pad for deployment:
  - Ensure all environment variables are configured.
  - Use `.env` files for sensitive data.

#### **Step 6: Connect to AWS for Deployment**
- Set up AWS resources:
  - Use EC2 for hosting the application.
  - Use RDS for database management.
  - Use S3 for static assets.
- Example AWS CLI command:
  ```bash
  aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 --instance-type t2.micro
  ```
