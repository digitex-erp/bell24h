### **Prompt to Proceed Without KredX API Key**

Hereâ€™s a structured prompt to continue your work on **Replit.com** while keeping placeholders for the KredX API key and secret. This ensures you can proceed with development without being blocked by the absence of the API credentials.

---

**Prompt**:
"I want to set up placeholder values for the KredX API key and secret in my project on Replit.com so that I can continue development without waiting for the actual credentials. Hereâ€™s what I need:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Add placeholders for `KREDX_API_KEY` and `KREDX_API_SECRET` in the `.env` file.
   - Example:
     ```env
     KREDX_API_KEY=YOUR_KREDX_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER
     KREDX_API_SECRET=YOUR_KREDX_API_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER
     ```

2. **Code Adjustments**:
   - Update the codebase to use these placeholders temporarily.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const kredxApiKey = process.env.KREDX_API_KEY || 'YOUR_KREDX_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER';
     const kredxApiSecret = process.env.KREDX_API_SECRET || 'YOUR_KREDX_API_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER';
     ```

3. **Mock API Responses**:
   - Create mock responses for KredX API endpoints to simulate functionality during development.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const mockKredxResponse = {
       status: 'success',
       data: {
         invoiceId: 'INV12345',
         discountRate: 0.5,
         amount: 10000,
       },
     };
     ```

4. **Proceed with Development**:
   - Continue implementing other features (e.g., RazorpayX integration, FSAT API) while waiting for the KredX API credentials.
   - Once the credentials are obtained, replace the placeholders and test the integration.

- Provide a step-by-step guide for setting up environment variables on Replit?
- Assist with creating mock API responses for KredX?
- Help integrate additional APIs like M1 Exchange?"

     Subject: Request for KredX API Key for Bell24h Integration

     Dear KredX Team,

     I hope this message finds you well. I am working on integrating KredX into our platform, Bell24h, which is a B2B marketplace for RFQs and supplier management. To proceed with the integration, I would like to request access to the KredX API.

     Please provide instructions on how to register and obtain the API key and secret. If there are any prerequisites or documentation required, kindly share them as well.

     Looking forward to your response.

     Best regards,
     [Your Name]
     [Your Contact Information]
     ```

3. **Follow Instructions**:
   - Once you receive a response, follow their registration process to obtain the API key and secret.

4. **Plan for Integration**:
   - After receiving the API credentials, allocate 14â€“15 working days for testing and integration.

### **Prompt to Add M1 Exchange API Key**

Hereâ€™s a prompt to add the M1 Exchange API key to your Replit project:

---

**Prompt**:
"I want to integrate the M1 Exchange API into my project on Replit.com. Since I may not have the API key yet, I will use placeholders for now. Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Add placeholders for `M1_EXCHANGE_API_KEY` and `M1_EXCHANGE_API_SECRET` in the `.env` file.
   - Example:
     ```env
     M1_EXCHANGE_API_KEY=YOUR_M1_EXCHANGE_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER
     M1_EXCHANGE_API_SECRET=YOUR_M1_EXCHANGE_API_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER
     ```

2. **Code Adjustments**:
   - Update the codebase to use these placeholders temporarily.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const m1ExchangeApiKey = process.env.M1_EXCHANGE_API_KEY || 'YOUR_M1_EXCHANGE_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER';
     const m1ExchangeApiSecret = process.env.M1_EXCHANGE_API_SECRET || 'YOUR_M1_EXCHANGE_API_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER';
     ```

3. **Mock API Responses**:
   - Create mock responses for M1 Exchange API endpoints to simulate functionality during development.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const mockM1ExchangeResponse = {
       status: 'success',
       data: {
         transactionId: 'TXN67890',
         exchangeRate: 82.5,
         amount: 50000,
       },
     };
     ```

4. **Proceed with Development**:
   - Continue implementing other features while waiting for the actual M1 Exchange API credentials.
   - Once the credentials are obtained, replace the placeholders and test the integration.

Would you like me to:
- Provide a step-by-step guide for setting up environment variables on Replit?
- Assist with creating mock API responses for M1 Exchange?
- Help integrate additional APIs or features?"

### **Final Answer**

To proceed without the KredX API key:
1. Use placeholders (`YOUR_KREDX_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER`, `YOUR_KREDX_API_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER`) in your `.env` file and codebase.
2. Create mock API responses to simulate functionality during development.
3. Follow the outlined process to contact KredX and obtain the API credentials.

To integrate M1 Exchange:
1. Use placeholders (`YOUR_M1_EXCHANGE_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER`, `YOUR_M1_EXCHANGE_API_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER`) in your `.env` file and codebase.
2. Create mock API responses for M1 Exchange.
3. Replace placeholders with actual credentials once obtained.

By following these steps, you can ensure uninterrupted development on **Replit.com** while awaiting API credentials. Let me know if youâ€™d like further assistance! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
