- Password hashing with bcrypt implemented for user security
- HTTPS/TLS encryption ready for production configuration

## Deployment Requirements

### Infrastructure

- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ with connection pooling
- **Server**: Node.js 18+ runtime environment
- **Caching**: Redis recommended for session storage and caching
- **Storage**: Object storage service for document uploads
- **CDN**: Content delivery network for static assets

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be configured:

```
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=<secure-random-string>
SESSION_SECRET=<secure-random-string>

# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai-api-key>
KREDX_API_KEY=<kredx-api-key>
KREDX_API_SECRET=<kredx-api-secret>
ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_URL=<ethereum-provider-url>

# Email Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=<sendgrid-api-key>

# Optional Features
SMS_PROVIDER_API_KEY=<sms-provider-api-key>
```

### Deployment Steps

1. Set up PostgreSQL database and run migrations
2. Configure environment variables according to the production environment
3. Build frontend assets using `npm run build`
4. Deploy server code to production environment
5. Set up monitoring and logging services
6. Configure HTTPS certificates and domain settings
7. Perform final smoke tests in the production environment

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Heavy concurrent usage (>1,000 simultaneous users) may require database optimization
- International payment processing may require additional regional integrations
- Mobile responsiveness has been implemented but should be tested on various devices

## Recommendations

1. **Phased Rollout**: Begin with a limited user base to identify any issues in the production environment
2. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement comprehensive monitoring for API performance and error tracking
3. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure regular database backups are configured
4. **Performance Optimization**: Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
5. **Documentation**: Provide user guides for different user roles (buyers, suppliers, administrators)

## Conclusion

The Bell24h Marketplace platform is ready for production deployment. All core features have been implemented, tested, and optimized. The platform provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly environment for B2B trade interactions with innovative AI-powered features and financial service integrations.
