# üö® EMERGENCY RECOVERY GUIDE

## üéØ **CRITICAL SITUATION**
Your localhost has only 3 pages but Vercel has 34 working pages. This must be fixed immediately.

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE RECOVERY STEPS**

### **Step 1: Run Full Recovery (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
npm run recovery:full
```
This will:
- Pull all pages from Vercel
- Verify all 34 pages are present
- Test that all pages work locally

### **Step 2: Manual Recovery (If Step 1 Fails)**

#### **Option A: Vercel CLI**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Link your project
vercel link

# Pull complete source
vercel pull --yes
```

#### **Option B: Manual Download**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your bell24h project
3. Click "Download" to get source code
4. Extract to current directory (overwrite existing files)

#### **Option C: Git Repository**
1. Check if Vercel is connected to a Git repository
2. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
3. Copy all files to current directory

### **Step 3: Verify Recovery**
```bash
# Check all pages are present
npm run recovery:verify

# Test all pages work
npm run recovery:test
```

### **Step 4: Start Development Server**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test in browser: http://localhost:3000
```

## üìä **EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER RECOVERY**

### **All 34 Pages Should Be Present:**
- `/` - Home page
- `/marketplace` - Main marketplace
- `/suppliers` - Supplier showcase
- `/rfq/create` - RFQ creation
- `/register` - User registration
- `/login` - User login
- `/categories/textiles-garments` - Category pages (16 categories)
- `/dashboard/ai-features` - AI features dashboard
- `/fintech` - Fintech services
- `/wallet` - Wallet functionality
- `/voice-rfq` - Voice RFQ
- `/about` - About page
- `/contact` - Contact page
- `/privacy` - Privacy policy
- `/terms` - Terms of service
- `/help` - Help page

### **Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] All 34 pages present in localhost
- [ ] `npm run dev` starts without errors
- [ ] All pages load at localhost:3000
- [ ] No broken links or missing assets
- [ ] Database connections work
- [ ] APIs are responding
- [ ] Build process works (`npm run build`)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL WARNINGS**

### **DO NOT:**
- Make any changes to Vercel until localhost is restored
- Add new features until all 34 pages are working locally
- Deploy anything until localhost matches Vercel

### **DO:**
- Backup current localhost first
- Verify all pages work before making changes
- Test everything locally before deploying

## üõ†Ô∏è **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Recovery Fails:**
1. Check Vercel CLI is installed: `vercel --version`
2. Ensure you're logged in: `vercel login`
3. Try manual download from Vercel dashboard
4. Check network connection

### **If Pages Don't Load:**
1. Check development server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Verify all dependencies installed: `npm install`
3. Check for build errors: `npm run build`
4. Review console for errors

### **If Some Pages Missing:**
1. Run verification: `npm run recovery:verify`
2. Check which pages are missing
3. Re-run recovery: `npm run recovery:pull`
4. Manually copy missing pages from Vercel

## üìû **SUPPORT**

### **Recovery Commands:**
```bash
# Full recovery process
npm run recovery:full

# Individual steps
npm run recovery:pull    # Pull from Vercel
npm run recovery:verify  # Verify pages present
npm run recovery:test    # Test pages work
```

### **Manual Recovery Files:**
- `MANUAL_RECOVERY_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed manual steps
- `page-verification-report.md` - Verification results
- `page-test-report.md` - Test results

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

After successful recovery:
- [ ] All 34 pages present in localhost
- [ ] Development server runs without errors
- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] Can navigate entire site locally
- [ ] Matches Vercel deployment exactly

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS AFTER RECOVERY**

1. **Verify everything works** locally
2. **Set up proper Git workflow**
3. **Create staging environment**
4. **Add new features safely** (like admin panel)
5. **Test in staging** before production
