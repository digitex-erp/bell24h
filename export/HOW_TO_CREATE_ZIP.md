# How to Create a ZIP File of Bell24h Project

Since we encountered issues with automatic ZIP creation in Replit, follow these manual steps:

## Option 1: Using Replit's Download Feature (Recommended)

1. In the Replit file sidebar, click the three dots (â‹®) menu
2. Select "Download as zip"
3. This will download most of the project files

## Option 2: Manual Download of Critical Files

If some files are missing in the ZIP from Option 1, download these critical files individually:

1. Right-click on each file in the list below
2. Select "Download" for each one
3. Add them to the ZIP file you downloaded in Option 1

### Critical Files to Check:
- `package.json`
- `.env.example`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `vite.config.js`
- `bell24h-unified-startup.js`
- All files in `client/src/`
- All files in `server/`
- All files in `shared/`

## Option 3: Using GitHubVZip for Complete Export (For Advanced Users)

If you have GitHub access:

1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Push the Bell24h project to that repository
3. Download the ZIP from GitHub

## After Downloading

1. Extract the ZIP file to a local directory
2. Follow the setup instructions in `export/README_FOR_EXPORT.md`

Remember to check `export/important_files.txt` to ensure all necessary files are included in your download.
