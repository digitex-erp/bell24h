## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS - MANUAL RAILWAY DASHBOARD**

### **Step 1: Check Railway Dashboard** (2 minutes)
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click on **bell24h-app** service
3. Check if deployment is now working
4. If still failing, proceed to Step 2

### **Step 2: Set Environment Variables in Dashboard** (3 minutes)
In Railway dashboard → bell24h-app → **Variables** tab, ensure these are set:
```env
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://bell24h-app-production.up.railway.app
PORT=3000
```

### **Step 3: Check Build Settings** (2 minutes)
In Railway dashboard → bell24h-app → **Settings** tab:
- **Build Command**: Leave empty (let Railway auto-detect)
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Root Directory**: Leave empty

### **Step 4: Redeploy** (3 minutes)
1. Click **"Redeploy"** button in Railway dashboard
2. Watch the build logs
3. Should complete in 2-3 minutes

## 🚀 **ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION - FRESH DEPLOYMENT**

### **If Still Failing, Try This:**
1. **Delete bell24h-app service** (keep Postgres)
2. **Create new service** → Deploy from GitHub
3. **Connect your GitHub repo**
4. **Railway will auto-configure everything**

### **Commands for Fresh Deployment:**
```bash
# Push to GitHub first
git push origin main

# Then in Railway dashboard:
# 1. Delete bell24h-app service
# 2. Create new service
# 3. Connect GitHub repo
# 4. Railway auto-deploys
```
