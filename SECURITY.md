## Monitoring & Alerting Verification Checklist (2025-05-26)
- [ ] Confirm APM dashboards (New Relic, Datadog, Sentry) are receiving live data.
- [ ] Trigger a test error (e.g., throw in a dev endpoint) and verify it appears in error tracking.
- [ ] Simulate credential rotation and verify alert/notification is received.
- [ ] Review CloudWatch logs for recent deployments and errors.
- [ ] Test alert escalation (email, Slack, etc.) for critical errors.
- [ ] Document all verification steps and outcomes.

> Contributors: Complete this checklist after every major deployment or infrastructure change.

## Overview
Bell24H.com is committed to maintaining the highest security standards for all data, infrastructure, and user interactions. This document outlines our security practices, controls, and audit procedures.

## Key Security Practices
- **Environment Variables & Secrets:**
  - All secrets are managed via environment variables and never committed to version control.
  - Use `.env.production.template` as a reference for production deployments.
- **Credential Rotation:**
  - Automated credential rotation enabled (see `.env.production.template`).
  - Alerts sent to `security@bell24h.com` upon rotation or anomaly detection.
- **Access Controls:**
  - Role-based access enforced in backend and admin panels.
  - Principle of least privilege for all cloud, DB, and CI/CD accounts.
- **Encryption:**
  - TLS/SSL enforced for all external and internal traffic.
  - Sensitive data encrypted at rest (DB, S3, backups).
- **Monitoring & Logging:**
  - Real-time monitoring via CloudWatch, New Relic, Datadog, or Sentry.
  - All access and error logs retained for 90 days.
- **Vulnerability Management:**
  - Regular dependency audits using `npm audit` and Snyk.
  - Monthly security reviews and patching.
- **Incident Response:**
  - Incidents reported to `security@bell24h.com`.
  - Incident response plan reviewed quarterly.
