     - **Description**: Add a brief description (e.g., "AI-powered RFQ marketplace").
     - **Privacy Setting**: Choose public or private based on your preference.
   - Click **Create Repository on GitHub**.

4. **Verify Remote Connection**:
   - Ensure the remote repository URL is correctly set:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```
     The output should show:
     ```
     origin https://github.com/your-username/bell24h.git (fetch)
     origin https://github.com/your-username/bell24h.git (push)
     ```

     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

2. **Commit Changes**:
   - Provide a meaningful commit message (e.g., "Initial commit for Bell24h").
   - Use the Git panel or terminal:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit for Bell24h"
     ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Use the Git panel to push changes:
     - Click **Push**.
   - Alternatively, use the terminal:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

### **Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables**
Ensure all required environment variables are configured in Replit‚Äôs **Secrets** tab:
1. **Access Secrets**:
   - Go to the **Secrets** tab (üîí icon) in Replit.

2. **Update `.env` Files**:
   - If you have `.env` files in your project, ensure they are properly configured.

---

### **Step 5: Install Dependencies**
Run the following command to install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

---

### **Step 6: Start the Development Server**
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Verify that the application runs correctly by navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

---

### **Step 7: Automate Workflow**
To streamline future development:
1. **Automate Dependency Installation**:
   - Add a `.replit` file to automate `npm install` on startup:
     ```plaintext
     run = "npm install && npm run dev"
     ```

2. **Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD**:
   - Set up workflows for automated testing and deployments.
