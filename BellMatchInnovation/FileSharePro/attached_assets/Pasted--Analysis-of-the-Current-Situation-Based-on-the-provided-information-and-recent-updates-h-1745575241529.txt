### **Analysis of the Current Situation**

Based on the provided information and recent updates, hereâ€™s a summary of the current status:

1. **Project Overview**:
   - **Bell24h Marketplace**: A B2B platform connecting buyers and suppliers with AI-driven matching and real-time communication.
   - **Core Features**: User authentication, RFQ management, WebSocket integration, AI matching, and payment systems.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Users need to act as both buyers and suppliers without role conflicts.
   - The project is 40% complete, with high-priority tasks like Hindi voice-based RFQ and video RFQ systems pending.

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to allow users to switch between buyer/supplier roles.
   - Update the database schema and frontend to support dynamic role switching.
   - Configure Replit for deployment and testing.

### **Solution: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

To allow users to act as both buyers and suppliers, follow these steps:

---

#### **Step 1: Update Database Schema**
1. **Add Roles to Users Table**:
   - Modify the `users` table to include a `roles` field (e.g., `buyer`, `supplier`, or both).
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN roles TEXT[] DEFAULT ARRAY['buyer', 'supplier'];
   ```

2. **Seed Sample Data**:
   - Add sample users with mixed roles:
     ```javascript
     // server/db/seed.js
     await db('users').insert({
       email: 'user@example.com',
       roles: ['buyer', 'supplier'],
     });
     ```

---

#### **Step 2: Implement Frontend Role Switching**
1. **Create Role Selector Component**:
   - Allow users to switch roles dynamically:
     ```jsx
     // frontend/components/RoleSwitcher.jsx
     import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthContext';

     const RoleSwitcher = () => {
       const { user, updateUserRoles } = useAuth();

       const handleRoleChange = (newRole) => {
         updateUserRoles(newRole);
       };

       return (
         <div>
           <button onClick={() => handleRoleChange('buyer')}>Buyer Mode</button>
           <button onClick={() => handleRoleChange('supplier')}>Supplier Mode</button>
         </div>
       );
     };
     ```

2. **Update Auth Context**:
   - Manage user roles in the authentication context:
     ```jsx
     // frontend/context/AuthContext.jsx
     export const AuthContext = createContext();

     const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
       const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

       const updateUserRoles = async (newRole) => {
         // Update user roles in the database
         await fetch('/api/update-role', {
           method: 'POST',
           body: JSON.stringify({ newRole }),
         });

         // Refresh user data
         const updatedUser = await fetch('/api/user');
         setUser(updatedUser);
       };

       return (
         <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, updateUserRoles }}>
           {children}
         </AuthContext.Provider>
       );
     };
     ```

---

#### **Step 3: Secure Endpoints Based on Roles**
1. **Middleware for Role Checks**:
   - Protect routes based on user roles:
     ```javascript
     // server/middleware/auth.js
     const checkRole = (requiredRole) => (req, res, next) => {
       if (!req.user.roles.includes(requiredRole)) {
         return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
       }
       next();
     };

     module.exports = { checkRole };
     ```

2. **Apply Middleware to Routes**:
   - Restrict access to buyer/supplier-specific endpoints:
     ```javascript
     // server/routes/buyer-routes.js
     router.post('/submit-rfq', checkRole('buyer'), submitRFQ);
     ```

---

#### **Step 4: Test Role Switching**
1. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the server and test role switching:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

2. **Verify Functionality**:
   - Ensure users can switch roles and access appropriate features.
