To ensure a smooth start and efficient implementation of the Bell24h RFQ Marketplace, follow these steps:

---

#### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
1. **Open Replit**:
   - Log in to Replit using `vishal_pendharkar@hotmail.com`.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Use the following command to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     gh repo clone digitex-erp/bell24h
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can use:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/digitex-erp/bell24h.git
     ```

3. **Verify Files**:

#### **Step 2: Set Up the Development Environment**
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file and add required variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials):
     ```plaintext
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
     ```

3. **Set Up Database**:
   - Configure PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM:
     ```bash
     npx drizzle-kit generate:pg
     ```

---

#### **Step 3: Begin Implementation**
1. **Approve Plan**:
   - Click the "Approve plan & start" button to begin implementing the core features.

2. **Prioritize Features**:
   - If certain features need prioritization (e.g., RFQ Management, WebSocket integration), specify them now.

3. **Select Technologies**:
   - Confirm preferred libraries and frameworks (e.g., TailwindCSS for styling, Redux for state management).

#### **Step 4: Implement Core Features**
1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**:
   - Set up Express backend with TypeScript.
   - Configure PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM.
   - Implement authentication system.
   - Create basic React frontend structure.

2. **Phase 2: RFQ Management**:
   - Develop RFQ creation, editing, and management features.
   - Implement supplier database and matching algorithm.
   - Create API endpoints for RFQ operations.

3. **Phase 3: Real-time Features**:
   - Integrate WebSocket server for notifications.
   - Implement real-time communication between buyers and suppliers.
   - Add notification system.

4. **Phase 4: Analytics & Security**:
   - Develop trading analytics dashboard.
   - Implement security features (rate limiting, input validation).
   - Add performance optimizations.
