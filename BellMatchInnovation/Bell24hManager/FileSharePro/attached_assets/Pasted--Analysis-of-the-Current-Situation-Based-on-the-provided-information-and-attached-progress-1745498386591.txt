### **Proposed Next Plan**

To ensure the project progresses efficiently and aligns with the TODO list, hereâ€™s a structured plan for the next steps:

---

#### **Step 1: Stabilize Workflow and Server Startup**
1. **Switch to JavaScript-Based Workflow**:
   - Since the TypeScript-based workflow is causing issues, finalize the switch to a JavaScript-based approach.
   - Ensure the `start_app.sh` script is stable and used consistently.

2. **Update `.replit` File**:
   - If possible, modify the `.replit` file to use the `start_app.sh` script:
     ```plaintext
     run = "./start_app.sh"
     ```

3. **Verify Stability**:
   - Test the application manually using the terminal:
     ```bash
     ./start_app.sh
     curl http://localhost:5000/api/rfqs
     curl http://localhost:5000/api/industries
     ```

---

#### **Step 2: Implement Testing and Quality Assurance**
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for API endpoints using frameworks like Jest or Mocha.
   - Example test for `/api/rfqs`:
     ```javascript
     const request = require('supertest');
     const app = require('../server');

     describe('GET /api/rfqs', () => {
       it('should return a list of RFQs', async () => {
         const response = await request(app).get('/api/rfqs');
         expect(response.status).toBe(200);
         expect(response.body.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
       });
     });
     ```

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interactions between frontend and backend components.
   - Use tools like Cypress or Selenium for end-to-end testing.

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Simulate high traffic using Artillery.io or JMeter.
   - Example Artillery configuration:
     ```yaml
     config:
       target: "http://localhost:5000"
       phases:
         - duration: 60
           arrivalRate: 10
     scenarios:
       - flow:
           - get:
               url: "/api/rfqs"
     ```

---

#### **Step 3: Complete Deployment and DevOps Tasks**
1. **Backup & Recovery**:
   - Set up automated backups for the PostgreSQL database.
   - Use tools like `pg_dump` for regular backups:
     ```bash
     pg_dump -U username -d bell24h > backup.sql
     ```

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Ensure GitHub Actions workflows are properly configured for automated testing and deployment.
   - Example workflow for deployment:
     ```yaml
     name: Deploy to Vercel

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       deploy:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v3
           - run: npm install
           - run: npm run build
           - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
             with:
               vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
               vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
               vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
     ```

---

#### **Step 4: Finalize Documentation**
1. **API Documentation**:
   - Use tools like Swagger or Postman to document API endpoints.
   - Example Swagger configuration:
     ```yaml
     openapi: 3.0.0
     info:
       title: Bell24h API
       version: 1.0.0
     paths:
       /api/rfqs:
         get:
           summary: List all RFQs
           responses:
             '200':
               description: A list of RFQs
     ```

2. **User Documentation**:
   - Provide step-by-step guides for using the platform (e.g., creating RFQs, submitting quotes).

3. **Developer Documentation**:
   - Include setup instructions, API usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
