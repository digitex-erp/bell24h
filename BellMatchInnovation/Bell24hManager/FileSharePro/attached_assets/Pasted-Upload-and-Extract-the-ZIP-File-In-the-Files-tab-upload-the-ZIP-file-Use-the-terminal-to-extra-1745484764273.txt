I understand you want to proceed with the Bell24h project setup. Let's go through this step-by-step, assuming you're working on this now:

Step 1: Confirm Transition Readiness
First, please confirm:

Do you have the Bell24h project ZIP file ready to upload?
Does your ZIP file contain all necessary files including .env, package.json, etc.?
Step 2: Set Up the New Replit Workspace
Log in to Replit:

Open your browser and go to https://replit.com
Log in using your samplinghub@gmail.com credentials
Create a New Repl:

Once logged in, click the "+ Create" button in the top-right corner
Select "New repl" from the dropdown menu
In the template selection, search for and select "Node.js"
In the "Title" field, enter "Bell24h"
Click the "Create Repl" button to create your new workspace
Upload and Extract the ZIP File:

In your new repl, look at the left sidebar and click on the "Files" icon
You should see a file browser panel open
Look for an upload button (often looks like an arrow pointing up)
Click it and select your Bell24h ZIP file from your computer
Wait for the upload to complete (you'll see it appear in your files list)
Click on the "Shell" or "Terminal" tab at the bottom of the screen
Type the following command to extract your ZIP file (replace with your actual filename):
unzip your-bell24h-zipfile.zip
If you get an error saying unzip is not installed, run:
apt-get update && apt-get install unzip
Then try the unzip command again
Let me know when you've completed these initial steps, and I'll guide you through the next parts of the process.
