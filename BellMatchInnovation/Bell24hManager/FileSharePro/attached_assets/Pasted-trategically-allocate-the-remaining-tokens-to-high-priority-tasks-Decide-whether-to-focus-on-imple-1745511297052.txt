trategically allocate the remaining tokens to high-priority tasks.
Decide whether to focus on implementing the work saved in GitHub or Snyk.
Solution: Strategic Advice for Next Steps
To maximize the value of the remaining tokens and ensure the project progresses efficiently, follow these steps:

Step 1: Prioritize High-Impact Tasks
Focus on Critical Issues :
Address the "No RFQs found or empty response" issue by verifying the /api/rfqs endpoint and ensuring mock data or database integration is functioning correctly.
Enhance error logging around fetch operations to capture more context for debugging.
Stabilize Workflow Execution :
Ensure the .replit configuration and workflows are aligned with your TypeScript setup.
Use the command npx tsc server/index.ts to compile TypeScript files before starting the server.
Resolve Security Vulnerabilities :
Run npm audit fix or npm audit fix --force to address any remaining vulnerabilities flagged during the npm install step.
Step 2: Allocate Remaining Tokens Wisely
Implement Work Saved in GitHub :
If the saved work in GitHub includes critical fixes or enhancements (e.g., TypeScript configuration, workflow scripts), prioritize implementing these changes.
Use the remaining tokens to test and verify the implemented changes in the live environment.
Leverage Snyk for Security :
If security vulnerabilities are a significant concern, use Snyk to scan and fix dependency issues.
Snyk can provide detailed insights into vulnerabilities and suggest remediation steps.
Balance Between GitHub and Snyk :
If both GitHub and Snyk contain important updates, allocate tokens based on urgency:
Use 5-6 tokens for implementing GitHub changes.
Use 4-5 tokens for addressing security issues via Snyk.
Step 3: Plan for Deployment
Prepare for Deployment :
Ensure all configurations within package.json and .replit files are correct for deployment.
Test the application locally using node server.js or npx tsc && node dist/server/index.js.
Set Up CI/CD Pipeline :
Configure GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool for automated testing and deployment.
Example workflow:
