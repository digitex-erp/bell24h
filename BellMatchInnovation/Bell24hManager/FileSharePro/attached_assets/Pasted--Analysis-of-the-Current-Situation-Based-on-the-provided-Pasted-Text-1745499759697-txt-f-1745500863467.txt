Based on the provided `Pasted_Text_1745499759697.txt` file and the attached information, hereâ€™s a summary of the current status:

1. **Completed Tasks**:
   - **Trading Features**: Implemented RFQ matching, quote submission, and security features.
   - **WebSocket Functionality**: Added real-time communication for RFQ updates.
   - **Testing**:
     - Comprehensive API test script created.
     - All API endpoints tested successfully.
   - **Database**:
     - PostgreSQL database set up with seeding for industries, categories, users, and RFQs.
   - **Documentation**:
     - Detailed `README.md` created.
     - Migration guide (`migration_guide.md`) documenting Python to JavaScript transition.
     - Running instructions (`running_instructions.md`) and deployment guide (`deployment_guide.md`) added.

2. **Key Achievements**:
   - Confirmed functionality of all core features (e.g., RFQ matching, WebSocket communication).
   - Minor fallback mechanism for missing `supplier_categories` table is working as expected.
   - Comprehensive documentation ensures smooth onboarding and deployment.

3. **Remaining Tasks**:
   - **UI/UX Implementation** (~0% complete):
     - Dashboard, trading interface, analytics, and mobile responsiveness need implementation.
   - **Testing & QA**:
     - Unit testing, integration testing, and user testing remain incomplete.
   - **Deployment & DevOps**:
     - Workflow configuration needs attention.
     - Backup & recovery mechanisms are partially implemented.
   - **Enhancements**:
     - Interactive data visualization.
     - One-click supplier recommendations.
     - Smart search with autocomplete and fuzzy matching.
     - Contextual help tooltips.
     - Animated RFQ journey progress tracker.
