### **Advice for `samplinghub@gmail.com` Replit User ID**

To ensure the project progresses efficiently and aligns with the TODO list, hereâ€™s a structured plan for the next module to be built:

---

#### **Step 1: Prioritize the Next Module**
Based on the TODO list and the current progress, the next logical step is to implement **Trading Features**. These are critical for the core functionality of the Bell24h Marketplace.

1. **Define Scope**:
   - **RFQ Creation**: Allow users to create and submit RFQs.
   - **Quote Submission**: Enable suppliers to submit quotes for RFQs.
   - **Real-Time Updates**: Use WebSockets to notify users of new RFQs or quotes.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Create API endpoints for:
     - Creating RFQs.
     - Submitting quotes.
     - Fetching RFQs and quotes.
   - Example API Endpoints:
     ```bash
     POST /api/rfq/create
     POST /api/quote/submit
     GET /api/rfq/list
     ```

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Build UI components for:
     - RFQ creation form.
     - Quote submission form.
     - RFQ/quote listing page.

---

#### **Step 2: Address Security Features**
Before deploying the trading features, ensure the application is secure:
1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Use middleware to limit API requests and prevent abuse.
3. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., API keys, user credentials) using libraries like `bcrypt`.

---

#### **Step 3: Develop UI/UX Components**
Once the backend is ready, focus on building the frontend:
1. **Dashboard**:
   - Display key metrics (e.g., active RFQs, pending quotes).
2. **Trading Interface**:
   - Provide an intuitive interface for creating RFQs and submitting quotes.
3. **Analytics**:
   - Visualize performance metrics (e.g., response time, success rate).
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**:
   - Ensure the application works seamlessly on mobile devices.

---

#### **Step 4: Test the Application**
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write tests for API endpoints and core functionalities.
2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interactions between frontend and backend.
3. **User Testing**:
   - Conduct beta testing with ~50 suppliers and ~50 buyers to gather feedback.
