### **Solution: Architecture and Implementation Plan**

#### **Step 1: Showcase Page Architecture**
The architecture for the Showcase Page can be broken down into the following components:

1. **Frontend**:
   - **Product Grid**: Display products in a responsive grid layout.
   - **Filtering & Sorting**: Allow users to filter and sort products by category, price, rating, etc.
   - **Call-to-Action (CTA)**: Add buttons for "View Details," "Contact Supplier," and "Add to Cart."
   - **Personalization**: Customize the page based on the user's role (e.g., supplier profile, product listings).

2. **Backend**:
   - **Database Schema**:
     - `users`: Store user details (e.g., name, email, role).
     - `products`: Store product details (e.g., name, description, price, category, supplier ID).
     - `subscriptions`: Track user subscription plans (e.g., Free, Basic, Advanced, Unlimited).
   - **API Endpoints**:
     - `GET /api/products/:supplierId`: Fetch products for a specific supplier.
     - `POST /api/products`: Add new products (restricted by subscription plan).
     - `PUT /api/products/:productId`: Update product details.
     - `DELETE /api/products/:productId`: Delete a product.

3. **Monetization**:
   - Use a payment gateway (e.g., RazorpayX) to handle subscription payments.
   - Offer incentives like free trials or wallet credits to encourage sign-ups.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Use caching (e.g., Redis) to improve performance for high-traffic pages.
   - Optimize database queries for faster retrieval of product data.
