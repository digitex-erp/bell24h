#### **Revenue Projections Table**
| **Revenue Stream**        | **Monthly Target** | **369-Day Projection** | **Mechanism**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Supplier Subscriptions    | â‚¹8 lakh            | â‚¹96 crore             | 12,500 suppliers Ã— â‚¹8,000/year (Pro/Enterprise tiers).                        |
| Transaction Fees          | â‚¹1.5 lakh          | â‚¹18 crore             | 2â€“5% fee on â‚¹30 crore/month transactions.                                     |
| Escrow Fees               | â‚¹50k              | â‚¹6 crore              | 1â€“2% fee on â‚¹50 crore/month escrow transactions.                              |
| Ad Revenue                | â‚¹2 lakh            | â‚¹24 crore             | Promoted listings, featured RFQs, and supplier ads.                           |
| Invoice Discounting (KredX)| â‚¹1 lakh            | â‚¹12 crore             | 0.5% fee on â‚¹20 crore/month invoice financing.                                |
| **Total**                 | â‚¹12.05 lakh        | â‚¹156 crore            | Exceeds â‚¹100 crore target with conservative estimates.                        |

#### **Analysis**
The current tariff plan does not fully align with the revenue projections:
- **Supplier Subscriptions**: The â‚¹96 crore projection assumes â‚¹8,000/year per supplier, which matches only the **Pro (Yearly)** and **Enterprise** tiers.
- **Transaction Fees**: The current tariff does not explicitly mention transaction fees or how they will be collected.
- **Escrow Fees**: The plan lacks clarity on escrow setup and associated fees.
- **Ad Revenue**: The tariff does not include details about ad pricing or promoted listings.
- **Invoice Discounting**: No mention of integration with KredX or associated fees.

#### **Key Observations**
- IndiaMART charges significantly higher fees for enterprise plans (â‚¹50,000+).
- Bell24hâ€™s current tariff is more affordable but lacks premium features like dedicated account managers or unlimited leads.
- To compete, Bell24h must offer unique value propositions such as AI-powered insights, blockchain escrow, and voice-based RFQs.
