## 🎯 **UNIFIED SINGLE LOGIN RULE IMPLEMENTED**

```typescript
// Single User Model supports both roles
model User {
  id String @id @default(cuid())
  email String @unique
  password String?
  name String?
  companyname String?
  role String? @default("SUPPLIER") // Can be "SUPPLIER", "BUYER", "BOTH"
  // ... unified fields for both roles
}
```

### **✅ Role Switching Logic:**

```typescript
const [currentRole, setCurrentRole] = useState('supplier');

const handleRoleToggle = () => {
  setCurrentRole(currentRole === 'supplier' ? 'buyer' : 'supplier');
};
```

### **✅ Interface Adaptation:**

- **Supplier Mode**: KYC upload, product management, RFQ responses
- **Buyer Mode**: RFQ creation, supplier search, order tracking, analytics
