| Core Features | 98% | NEAR COMPLETE |
| High-Priority Features | 97% | NEAR COMPLETE |

Based on planning documents, codebase analysis, and Windsurf AI logs, here's the current status of the service/supplier showcase and product catalog:

### 🧩 1. Showcase/Catalog Status
#### 🔧 What’s Implemented
- ✅ Basic Structure
  - HTML/CSS templates for seller profiles and product grids exist in `client/src/pages/seller-showcase.tsx` and `client/src/components/ProductCatalog.tsx`.
  - Fallback logic for missing tables (e.g., `supplier_categories`) is active.
- ✅ Dynamic Data Fetching
  - `server/api/supplier.js` includes endpoints for fetching supplier data.
  - `client/src/hooks/useSupplierData.ts` handles catalog rendering.
- ⏳ Partial Integration
  - Supplier profiles and product listings are visible in the UI.
  - No live data from the database yet (e.g., `supplier_categories` table is missing).
  - No connection to pricing or traffic analytics pages.

### 🧩 2. Connection to Pricing & Traffic Pages
#### 🔧 Pricing Page
- ⏳ Pending
  - No direct integration between showcase/catalog and pricing logic.
  - Pricing data is hardcoded in `server/api/pricing.js`.
  - Dynamic pricing suggestions via AI (e.g., `ai-pricing.ts`) is partially implemented but not linked to the showcase.
#### 🔧 Traffic Analytics Page
- ⏳ Pending
  - `server/api/analytics.js` exists but lacks data from the catalog.
  - No real-time traffic tracking for product views or RFQs.
  - `client/src/pages/traffic.tsx` is a placeholder.

### 🧩 3. Key Files & Progress
#### ✅ Implemented
- `client/src/pages/seller-showcase.tsx`
- `client/src/components/ProductCatalog.tsx`
- `server/api/supplier.js`
- `client/src/hooks/useSupplierData.ts`
#### ⏳ Pending
- `supplier_categories` table in the database (missing in `server/models/schema.ts`).
- Link to pricing logic (e.g., `ai-pricing.ts` not connected to catalog).
- Traffic analytics integration (no live data in `traffic.tsx`).
- Responsive design for mobile (TODO: "Touch-friendly Interface").

### 🧩 4. Why It’s Not Fully Resonating with Pricing/Traffic Pages
- **Missing Database Table**: `supplier_categories` is required for dynamic catalog filtering but is not created. Logs show:
  ```
  Warning: supplier_categories table not found. Using fallback logic.
  ```
- **No API Link**: `server/api/supplier.js` does not fetch pricing or traffic data. `client/src/pages/seller-showcase.tsx` lacks integration with pricing logic.
- **UI/UX Gaps**: Catalog is static (no dynamic filtering or pricing suggestions). Traffic analytics page is a placeholder with no real data.

### 🧩 5. Next Steps to Complete the Showcase
1. **Finalize Database Schema**
   - Run Drizzle ORM to create missing table
     ```bash
     npx drizzle-kit generate
     ```
2. **Connect to Pricing Logic**
   - Update `server/api/supplier.js` to include pricing data.
   - Link `ai-pricing.ts` to catalog UI.
3. **Integrate Traffic Analytics**
   - Add real-time view tracking in `server/api/analytics.js`.
   - Update `client/src/pages/traffic.tsx` to display catalog traffic data.
4. **Optimize for Mobile**
   - Use `windsurf ui optimize --target=mobile` for responsiveness.

### 🧩 6. Final Checklist
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| ✅ Supplier Showcase UI | Done | Basic structure exists. |
| ⏳ Pricing Integration | ⏳ Pending | Requires API updates. |
| ⏳ Traffic Analytics | ⏳ Pending | Placeholder UI needs data. |
| ⏳ Mobile Responsiveness | ⏳ Pending | TODO.md mentions "Touch-friendly Interface". |
| ⏳ Database Table (`supplier_categories`) | ⏳ Pending | Missing in `schema.ts`. |
