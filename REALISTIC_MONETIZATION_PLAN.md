## üöÄ **READY TO IMPLEMENT**

**Your platform is a good portfolio piece, but it's not ready for ‚Çπ100 crore scale. Focus on survival first, then growth.**

**Ready to implement the realistic ‚Çπ50 lakh plan instead of the impossible ‚Çπ100 crore dream?**

## üìû **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Accept the reality** - ‚Çπ50 lakh is achievable, ‚Çπ100 crore is not
2. **Start manual services** - Use what you have to generate revenue
3. **Focus on one category** - Don't try to be everything to everyone
4. **Use WhatsApp** - It's free and works better than complex systems
5. **Charge upfront** - Don't build complex wallet systems yet

**Let's build a profitable business, not a tech fantasy.**
