# üö® Vercel Build Still Failing - Summary

## THE ISSUE

Vercel is showing the OLD code even though we fixed the file.

**Build Error Log Shows:**
```
Line 318: maxLength="6"    ‚ùå (old code - STRING)
```

**Local File Shows:**
```
Line 318: maxLength={6}    ‚úÖ (fixed code - NUMBER)
```

**Why:** Vercel cloned commit `7c26301` which appears to have been built BEFORE our fix was properly saved/committed.

---

## THE ROOT CAUSE

The fix WAS applied to the file, but:
1. The commit might not have actually saved the change
2. Or Vercel is using cached build
3. Or the file path structure is different than expected

---

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

Since commands aren't working via terminal, manually:

### **Option 1: Manual Fix in VS Code**
```
1. Open VS Code
2. File ‚Üí Open Folder
3. Navigate to: C:\Users\Sanika\Projects\bell24h\client
4. Open: src/app/admin/msg91-otp/page.tsx
5. Go to line 318 (Ctrl+G ‚Üí 318)
6. Find: maxLength="6"
7. Change to: maxLength={6}
8. Save (Ctrl+S)
9. In terminal:
   cd C:\Users\Sanika\Projects\bell24h\client
   git add src/app/admin/msg91-otp/page.tsx
   git commit -m "Fix: Force maxLength fix"
   git push origin main
```

### **Option 2: Vercel Manual Redeploy**
```
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard/bell24h-v1
2. Click on latest failed deployment
3. Click: "..." menu ‚Üí "Redeploy"
4. This forces Vercel to use latest commit
```

---

## WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

**The file needs to be properly saved with:**
```typescript
maxLength={6}  // Not maxLength="6"
```

**Then:**
1. Commit with change
2. Push to GitHub
3. Let Vercel rebuild

---

**OR** wait for terminal commands to work and rerun the fix.
