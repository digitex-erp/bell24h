## 🚀 **QUICK SETUP GUIDE (5 minutes)**

### Step 1: Create Environment File

Create a file called `.env.local` in the `client` directory with this content:

```env
# Bell24H Development Environment Configuration

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3001"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="dev-secret-key-for-local-development-only"

# ==============================================
# 🚨 CLOUDINARY CONFIGURATION - REQUIRED
# ==============================================
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"

# ==============================================
# OPTIONAL CONFIGURATIONS
# ==============================================
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
MAX_FILE_SIZE="50000000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_VOICE_RFQ="true"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_UPLOAD="true"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SMART_MATCHING="true"
NODE_ENV="development"
```

### Step 2: Get FREE Cloudinary Account

1. **Visit**: https://cloudinary.com
2. **Sign Up**: Create a free account (no credit card required)
3. **Get Credentials**: From your dashboard at https://console.cloudinary.com/dashboard

### Step 3: Replace Placeholder Values

Copy these values from your Cloudinary dashboard:

- **Cloud Name**: Found at the top of your dashboard
- **API Key**: In the "Account Details" section
- **API Secret**: In the "Account Details" section (click "reveal")

### Step 4: Test Upload System

1. Start server: `npm run dev`
2. Login: `demo@bell24h.com` / `demo123`
3. Go to Dashboard → Upload Product
4. Test file upload!

## 🎯 **Alternative: Quick Test Mode**

If you want to test immediately without Cloudinary, update the `.env.local` file to include:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_UPLOADS="true"
```

This will simulate uploads for testing other features while you set up Cloudinary.
