## Overview

The Project Status Dashboard visualizes the current status of the Bell24H project, including:
- Feature implementation status and completion percentages
- Service completeness and deficiencies
- API endpoint implementation status
- Infrastructure readiness
- Test coverage and quality metrics

The dashboard is built using modern web technologies such as Material Web Components ("Stitch UI") and AG-Grid, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Accessing the Dashboard

The Project Status Dashboard is accessible at the following URL:
```
http://localhost:3000/project-status
```

Authentication is required to access the dashboard. Unauthenticated users will be redirected to the login page.

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Status Overview
- Overall project completion percentage
- Visual progress bar showing the overall status
- Summary of critical metrics

### 2. Feature Status Tab
- Detailed list of features and their implementation status
- Sortable and filterable table with completion percentages
- Color-coded status indicators

### 3. Services Tab
- Implementation status of key services (AuthService, EmailService, etc.)
- Percentage of incompleteness for each service
- Filterable table with pagination

### 4. API Endpoints Tab
- Status of API endpoint implementation
- Documentation status
- Test coverage metrics

### 5. Infrastructure Tab
- Deployment and infrastructure readiness
- Environment configuration status
- Performance benchmarks

### 6. Testing Tab
- Test coverage metrics
- Quality assurance status
- Automated testing implementation progress

## Technologies Used

The dashboard is built with the following technologies:
- **React**: Functional components with hooks
- **Next.js**: App Router framework for routing and SSR
- **Material Web Components**: Google's "Stitch UI" components for consistent Material Design
- **AG-Grid**: Enterprise-level data grid for feature-rich tables
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling

## RTL Support

The dashboard includes full RTL (Right-to-Left) language support for:
- Arabic
- Hebrew
- Farsi
- Urdu

### RTL Features:
- Dynamic direction switching without page reload
- Properly aligned components in RTL mode
- Correct text rendering for RTL languages
- Bidirectional UI that respects content direction

To toggle between LTR and RTL modes, use the RTL/LTR button in the navigation bar.

## Authentication

The dashboard implements a secure authentication flow:
- Protected routes that redirect unauthenticated users
- Loading state during authentication check
- Role-based visibility of dashboard sections
- Secure user session management

## Performance Optimizations

The dashboard incorporates several performance optimizations:
- Pagination for large data sets
- Lazy loading of table data to prevent UI blocking
- Optimized AG-Grid configuration for large data sets
- Efficient re-rendering through proper React hooks usage

## Usage Guidelines

### Interpreting Status Indicators
- **Green**: Complete or low risk (less than 10% incomplete)
- **Yellow**: Moderate risk (10-30% incomplete)
- **Red**: High risk (more than 30% incomplete)

### Filtering and Sorting
- Click on column headers to sort data
- Use the filter icon to filter by specific criteria
- Pagination controls allow navigation through large datasets

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements for the dashboard include:
- Export capabilities for PDF, Excel, and CSV formats
- Customizable dashboard layout and widgets
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Real-time updates via WebSocket integration
- Enhanced filter and search capabilities
- Integration with issue tracking systems

## Contribution

When contributing to the dashboard, please ensure:
- Full test coverage for new components
- Proper RTL support for all UI elements
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Consistent use of Material Web Components
