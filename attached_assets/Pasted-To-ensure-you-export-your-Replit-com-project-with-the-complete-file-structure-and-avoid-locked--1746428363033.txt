To ensure you export your Replit.com project with the **complete file structure** (and avoid locked or missing files), follow these best practices and prompts:

## Step-by-Step Guide for Clean Export from Replit

### 1. **Organize and Build Your Project for Production**
- If your project uses a build step (like React, Next.js, or Node.js), run the build command in the Replit shell/terminal:
  - For Node.js/React:  
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
  - This will generate a `dist` or `build` folder with production-ready files[5].

### 2. **Check for Hidden or Special Files**
- Make sure all important files (including `.env`, `.replit`, config files, etc.) are visible and not hidden.
- If using Python, ensure `requirements.txt` and `.replit` are present[7][8].

### 3. **Download as ZIP (Manual Method)**
- In the Replit file sidebar, click the **three dots** (⋮) and select **Download as zip**[2][3][5].
- This downloads the entire visible project folder, including subfolders and files.

### 4. **If Files Are Missing or Locked**
- **Manual Download:**  
  - For any missing or locked files, right-click each file and select **Download** individually[2].
- **Scripted Export (Advanced):**  
  - Use a community script or CLI tool (like [replit-exporter][4] or [Lyq322/Replit-downloader][6]) to automate downloading all files, including hidden ones:
    ```bash
    replit-export --output repls/ --auth 
    ```
  - You’ll need your Replit session cookie for this (see tool documentation for details)[4][6].

### 5. **Check and Unzip**
- After downloading, unzip the file and verify all folders and files are present.
- If any files are still missing, copy-paste their contents manually from the Replit editor.

## **Prompt to Use in Replit Before Download**

There is **no specific text prompt** you can enter in Replit to unlock all files for download.  
**Actions you should take:**
- Ensure all files and folders you want are visible in the file tree.
- Download as zip.
- For locked/missing files, download individually or use a CLI/script as above.

---

## **If You Still Face Locked or Skipped Files**

- Use the [replit-exporter CLI][4] or [Lyq322/Replit-downloader][6] to fetch all files, including hidden/system files.
- As a last resort, open each locked file in the Replit editor and manually **copy-paste** the content into new files on your local machine.
