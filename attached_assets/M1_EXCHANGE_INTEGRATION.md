## Architecture
The M1 Exchange integration consists of:

1. **Frontend Components**:
   - `M1ExchangeEarlyPayment.tsx`: Component for requesting early payments
   - `M1ExchangeTransactions.tsx`: Component for viewing transaction history
   - Integration in `milestone-approval.tsx`: Tab-based interface for financial services

2. **Backend Services**:
   - `m1exchange-service.ts`: Service layer with business logic
   - `m1exchange-controller.ts`: API controllers for handling requests
   - RESTful API endpoints in `routes.ts`

3. **Database Tables**:
   - `m1exchange_transactions`: Stores transaction records
   - Integration with `milestones` and `wallets` tables

## Early Payment Process Flow

1. Supplier views an approved milestone on the milestone approval page
2. Supplier clicks "Request Early Payment" in the M1 Exchange tab
3. System verifies milestone eligibility (must be approved and not already paid)
4. M1 Exchange service creates a new transaction record
5. Funds are reserved in the escrow account
6. Supplier receives notification of early payment processing
7. Upon completion, funds are transferred to supplier's wallet
8. Transaction status is updated in the system

## Integration with Escrow and Wallet System

The M1 Exchange service integrates with Bell24h's escrow account and wallet system:

1. Each user has a dedicated escrow account for holding funds
2. The wallet system manages user balances and transactions
3. When early payment is requested:
   - Funds are moved from escrow to a pending state
   - Upon approval, funds are transferred to the supplier's wallet
   - The system maintains a complete audit trail of all transactions

## Dual Financial Service Integration

Bell24h offers two financial service providers:

1. **KredX**: For invoice discounting and financing
2. **M1 Exchange**: For early milestone payments

The system allows users to choose their preferred financial service provider based on their specific needs and the terms offered.
