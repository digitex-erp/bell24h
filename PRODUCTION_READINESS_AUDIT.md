2. Image optimization and lazy loading
3. Caching strategies implementation
4. Performance monitoring setup

#### üî¥ MONITORING & ANALYTICS (20%)
**Current State**: Monitoring infrastructure exists but not configured
```typescript
// Sentry config exists but needs production setup

  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "test:ci": "npm run test:unit && npm run test:integration && npm run test:e2e"
}
```

**Coverage Requirements**: 80%+ across all metrics ‚úÖ
**Testing Types**: Unit, Integration, E2E, Performance ‚úÖ
**Status**: Production-ready testing infrastructure ‚úÖ

### 5. PAYMENT INTEGRATION: üü° 75%

#### üü° PAYMENT GATEWAYS CONFIGURED:
```typescript
// Full payment infrastructure exists
const razorpay = new Razorpay({
  key_id: process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY_ID,     // Needs production keys
  key_secret: process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET  // Needs production keys
});
```

**Supported Providers**: Razorpay, Stripe, PayPal ‚úÖ
**Integration Status**: Development keys, needs production credentials ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üö® CRITICAL PRODUCTION BLOCKERS

### PRIORITY 1: AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM (Timeline: 1 Week)
```bash
# CRITICAL - Must implement before any production deployment
STATUS: Using localStorage mock sessions - SECURITY RISK
IMPACT: No real user management or security
SOLUTION: Production NextAuth setup with database sessions
```

### PRIORITY 2: DATABASE INFRASTRUCTURE (Timeline: 1 Week)  
```bash
# CRITICAL - Must implement for data persistence
STATUS: Using SQLite dev database
IMPACT: No real data storage or scalability
SOLUTION: Production PostgreSQL with proper schemas
```

### PRIORITY 3: REAL API IMPLEMENTATION (Timeline: 2 Weeks)
```bash
# HIGH PRIORITY - Must implement for business functionality
STATUS: Sophisticated mock APIs throughout
IMPACT: Beautiful UI but no real business operations
SOLUTION: Replace mocks with actual backend services
```
